   ===   RPGUnit   ===

RPGUnit is a regression testing framework similar to JUnit
(http://www.junit.org/). Instead of targetting the Java language, it focuses
on RPG ILE, a language found mainly on the iSeries (a.k.a. AS/400) platform.

In JUnit, developpers write one class per test suite and one method per test
case. In RPGUnit, they write one NoMain RPG module per test suite and one
exported procedure per test case. After compiling the test suite as an ILE
service program, the framework can run all test cases and produce a test run
report, indicating any failure or error found.

RPGUnit is RPG-centric in three ways.
1. The unit tests are usually written in RPG. Thus, RPG programmers can write
their own automated unit tests in a language they know well. Still, any ILE
language can also be used.
2. The test framework can test programs written in RPG. Still, any iSeries
program can be tested, regardless of the implementation language.
3. The test framework itself is written in RPG. This is an application of the
'eat your own dog food' slogan.

More information can be found on the RPGUnit website: http://www.rpgunit.org

The framework was built and tested with V5R3. It is meant to work on V5R1 and
later. If you find a portability issue, please open a bug request on the
website.

The files included in the distribution are:
- RPGUNIT1		The framework itself
- RPGUNITC1		Commands to call the framework
- RPGUNITF1		Fixtures for testing the framework
- RPGUNITT1		Tests for the framework itself
- RPGUNITY1		Prototypes
